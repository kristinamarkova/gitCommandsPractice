How to merge conflicts in Git:

1. After making some changes in the code
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "message goes here"
4. git pull (to pull changes that happened while you were coding)
5. git push

Here is a merge-conflict scenario:
1. Find all the files that have a conflict (CONFLICT (content): ... the files)
2. Inside the conflicted files there are the symbols: 
	<<<<<<<< HEAD
	your code
	=========
	other's code
	>>>>>>>> (commit ID)
3. Fix conflict by removing one of the lines or adding them both and also removing the HEAD and other conflict symbols
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "Merge"
6. git push
